    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <p>How to cook it is as follows</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to <strong>180C/160 fan/gas</strong> 4 and grease an ovenproof dish. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the onions, sizzle for <em>5 mins</em>, then remove half and put in a large bowl with the mince, egg, breadcrumbs, sage, feta and chopped bay. Season well and mix. Shape into a long sausage shape and transfer to the greased dish. Put the remaining bay leaves on top, drizzle with a little more oil and put in the oven for <em>40-45 mins</em> until cooked through.</li>
        
        <li>Meanwhile, keep the remaining onions on a low heat in the pan. Cook for <em>2 mins</em>, then increase the heat and pour in the passata with <strong>70ml</strong> water. Bubble for <em>30 mins</em> on a low heat, stirring often, or until the meatloaf is ready to come out of the oven. Season to taste.</li>

        <li>Cook the spaghetti following pack instructions. When everything is ready, toss the spaghetti in the tomato sauce, slice the meatloaf and let everyone help themselves.</li>
    </ol>
