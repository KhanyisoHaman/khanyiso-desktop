        Life at Life Choices is a blessing, many would agree with this. We have life skills sessions, where I learnt about the importance and the power of self talk. Another thing I have learnt from life skills is the 3 advices the old man gave the farmer, which are: Mind your business, Don't take shortcuts and Think before you act.There is another which is called profdev.

    <p>
        ProfDev is an acronym for Professional Development, it focus on helping us to devlopment and grow in other words it like a self development course. In profdev I have laernt about the art of defining words and the importance of a CV. We also learnt about design thinking, which is to have a different way of thinking when faced with a problem, situation or crisis.

        Last but definetly not the least is the coding part. In coding which is what most if not all of us came to Life Choices for. We just finshed learning about HTML, which stands for Hyperlink Text Mark-up language. We just started with CSS which stands Cascading Style Sheet and I am super excited to be here, I don't regret one bit of my decision to join Life Choices instead of university.
